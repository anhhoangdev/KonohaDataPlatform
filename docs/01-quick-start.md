# ðŸš€ Quick Start â€“ End-to-End Deployment

Spin up the entire Konoha Data Platform on **Minikube** with just **three** commands.

> Estimated time: **15 minutes** on a laptop with 4 CPUs & 8 GiB RAM.

---

## 1. Spin-up the Cluster
```bash
./start-minikube.sh start          # creates/starts Minikube with addons
```

## 2. Build Images & Deploy Core Infra
```bash
./deploy-complete.sh              # builds images, loads them, deploys Vault (+ port-forward)
```
When it finishes you'll have:
â€¢ All custom Docker images already inside the cluster
â€¢ Namespaces created, Vault dev mode running and port-forwarded to http://localhost:8200 (token `root`)

## 3. Let Terraform Do the Magic
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve      # â˜• wait ~10 min â€“ full stack appears
```

Vault, MinIO, Hive Metastore, Iceberg, Kyuubi, Airflow, Trino, Grafana, etc. are up and wired together.
