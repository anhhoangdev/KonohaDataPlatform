# Konoha Data Platform

> **An all-in-one, cloud-native analytics stack—Data Lake, Streaming, Orchestration and Observability—deployed with a single command on your laptop.**
> Built with HashiCorp Vault, FluxCD GitOps, Apache Iceberg, Kyuubi and a curated suite of open-source services, Konoha transforms any vanilla Kubernetes cluster into a fully-featured data platform in < 15 minutes.

👉 **Looking for deep-dive technical docs?** Start with [`docs/00-introduction.md`](docs/00-introduction.md) and the [Architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md). Each component (Kyuubi, Iceberg, Airflow, …) has its own detailed page inside `docs/components/`.

## 🌪️ Naruto-Style TL;DR

> Spin up a full-blown data village in <15 minutes.
> Spark-powered compute = Nine-Tails chakra. Airflow = Hokage mission board.
> Vault seals your secrets; Trino's Byakugan queries everything. Believe it!
